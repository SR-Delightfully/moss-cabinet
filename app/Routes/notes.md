What we're working on today: 
We'll be looking at requirement #6 - flash messages
this is known as middleware

We'll be looking at 2FA in another lab


Reviewing the concept of sessions:
Why do you need one? how do you define one?

everytime you send inputs like search keywords for example, these inputs are not saved in the server
why is this a problem?

when adding items to a cart, these objects needs to be managed and processed. They need to be remembered on the server side
the solution? Save this information in a session. 

what is a session?
a session is a use case scenario. for example user authentication, shopping carts, user preferences, multi-step forms, etc. 
how does it work? 
when a sessions is created a unique id is generated by the server, this id will be sent to the browser as a cookie. the browser sends the session id with each request.

To create a session:
this is done using a number of functions created by php
session_start()
session_destroy()
session_regenerate_id()
session_unset()
isset($_SESSION['key'])
unset($_SESSION['key'])

The first step: 
you need to start the session. this needs to be called before any html or whitespace input.
if you do not, this might result in an error stating that the headers are already sent. 

second step:
Add session data

third step:
Read session data

* note that it is recommended to first check if the data is set/available before use
